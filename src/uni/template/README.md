# Template

This recipe is a template for you create your own recipes.

If you test it using UNI it will print 'hello cooks' message on terminal.

For your recipe, just clone this repository and take this template as a base. Create a folder in ``/src/`` named with your github user name and create a separated folder inside it for each recipe created by you. Just take a look inside this template folder how the things works and make your own.
